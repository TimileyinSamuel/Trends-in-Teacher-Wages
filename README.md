# Trends-in-Teacher-Wages
The Economic Policy Institute (EPI) published an [article](https://www.epi.org/publication/teacher-pay-penalty-2022/) on the long-term trends in teacher wages and compensation. The article includes four charts depicting trends in teacher pay from 1979 to 2021. In this post, I use ggplot2 in R to recreate one of those charts, which compares the average weekly wages of public school teachers and other college graduates from 1979 to 2021.
